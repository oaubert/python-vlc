Example usage of VLC API function `libvlc_media_new_callbacks`
This function allows to create a VLC media `libvlc_media_t` specifying custom
callbacks where the user can define how to manage and read the stream of data.

The general use case for this is when you have data in memory and you want to
play it (e.g. audio stream from a web radio).

In this example, we are going to read playable data from files in a specified
folder. In case you would want to read from a file, it is not the best way to do it,
but for the sake of this example we are going to read data into memory from files.

The example tries to highlight the separation of concerns between the callbacks and
the application logic, so it would hopefully make clear how to integrate the VLC API
with existing libraries.

In particular, we have two main parts:
    - StreamProvider: which is a class that implements the logic; "scrape" a folder
    for files with a specific extensions, and provide methods that retrieves data.
    - VLC callabacks that uses a StreamProvider object
